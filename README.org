** Visualizations

*** Red Black Tree
[[./images/rbt.png]]

*** Leftist Heap
[[./images/leftist_heap.png]]

*** Binomial Heap
[[./images/bin_heap.png]]

** Known Issues
1. If the Tree is not rendered with a default tree, the
   layout hides the label of the root node. So, we always start the
   visualization with some defaults
2. Binomial heap viz - The children of heap are not displayed in
   increasing order of rank.
3. Binomial heap viz - Multiple roots problem was avoided by
   introducing a root node called "heap"
